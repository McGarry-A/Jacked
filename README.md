# JACKED 


## Current state of Jacked

This application is currently still in progress and I work on it during my free time. Although most of the MVP is there, I am still working on this application to squash bugs, improve UI/UX and add additional features I think are important to the USP of this applcation. 

Eventually, I aim to release this application to the Andriod and iOS app stores.

## The Purpose of the App

This is an application that's main function is tracking and logging workouts for active gym members. I decided to create this app because working out is a personal hobby and many of the apps on the market either lack functionality or are cumbersome to use. 

Some apps I loved using included [Strong](https://www.strong.app/) and [Boostcamp](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boostcamp-workout-plans-log/id1529354455) for very different reasons.

Strong is a fantastic app that is intuative to use and includes so many awesome features including graphs and charts to visualise your progress.
Boostcamp was less intuative in the workout part of the application, but its unique selling point is that you can enroll onto coaches programmes and have set workouts based on your current fitness levels.

Hence, I would like to create an application that encompasses the strengths of both these apps. A slick and simple UI that helps you track and log progress, but also cater to individuals who like a structured routine in the gym and perhaps even coaches who would like to push their programmes to gym goers world-wide.

## The Technologies 

This application is built using the following technologies and packages:
- React Native
- Redux 
- Supabase (Backend)
- Native base 
- React Native Chart Kit
- Expo
- React Navigation

Compatible on iOS and Andriod.

## Testing

I currently do not have an Apple developer account and this application is not yet ready to be released to the app store. 
So, here are a few ways to check this app out for yourself:

### Guided tour via YouTube (Quick overview)

For those who want to quickly check out the application and get a brief overview of the functionality, I have created a [YouTube](www.youtube.com) video which shows me going 
going through the application on my iPhone 11.

### Pre-release using Expo Go (Detailed Look)

For those who want a more indepth look into the application on your own device, you can download the [Expo go app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)
and visit my [expo profile](https://expo.dev/@ahmedmcgarry) to build the application.

## Final Thoughts

This is my first React Native project.
Stay tuned for updates and more information.
