# JACKED 


## Current state of Jacked

This application is currently still in progress and I work on it during my free time. Although most of the MVP is there, I am still working on this application to squash bugs, improve UI/UX and 
add additional features I think are important to the USP of this applcation. 

Eventually, I aim to release this application to the Andriod and iOS app stores.

## The Purpose of the App

This is an application that's main function is tracking and logging workouts for active gym members. I decided to create this app because working out is a personal hobby
and alot of the apps on the market either lack functionality or are cumbersome to use. 

## The Technologies 

This application is built using the following technologies and packages:
- React Native
- Redux 
- Supabase (Backend)
- Native base 
- React Native Chart Kit
- Expo
- React Navigation

Compatible on iOS and Andriod.

## Testing

I currently do not have an Apple developer account and this application is not yet ready to be released to the app store. 
So, here are a few ways to check this app out for yourself:

### Guided tour via YouTube (Quick overview)

For those who want to quickly check out the application and get a brief overview of the functionality, I have created a [YouTube](www.youtube.com) video which shows me going 
going through the application on my iPhone 11.

### Pre-release using Expo Go (Detailed Look)

For those who want a more indepth look into the application on your own device, you can download the [Expo go app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)
and visit my page to preview the application.

## Final Thoughts

This is my first React Native project.
Stay tuned for updates and more information.
